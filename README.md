# Sentiment Based Product Recommendation System

## Brief Description
In the e-commerce & retail industry data such as ratings & reviews are often collected from  customers who used, liked or purchased a product. When a lot of customers gave good reviews to a product other customers are more likely to buy them after reading the reviews. 
Sentiment analysis uses the ratings & review data to create a model that is later used to recommend the same or similar product with similar ratings to other users. This way of product recommendation has been a useful & proven method in e-commerce & retail sectors.

### Problem Statement Overview
Have you ever wondered how e-commerce websites such as Amazon or Flipkart are giving you product recommendations that are quite similar to your likings or are similar to the products that you have already bought from these platforms? Did you ever notice that these platforms ask you to rate and review their products when you buy a product from them?

You can also rate or review any product that you want to without even buying it from their website.
Can you relate now if you are reviewing a product positively then you may find a similar product in your recommendation list to buy?


It'd be interesting to build an end-to-end recommendation system to recommend products to the users that they will most probably like, based on their purchase history & reviews and ratings given by the other users for the products. Suppose you want to buy a particular product from any e-commerce website. You check the reviews of that product, and if people are giving positive responses or higher ratings, then the product is considered good to buy, and if there are more negative responses or lower ratings, then it is not considered a good buy. 


But, the recommendation system works on how you can automate this process and then recommend the products to other users based on the previously existing reviews and ratings. 
The objective of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews given by different customers corresponding to the products which are available to buy on an e-commerce platform and provide recommendations of similar products which have positive reviews and good ratings.

 

#### Steps taken in this project-
- We get the reviews dataset.
- Perform cleanups as required on the dataset.
- Perform sentiment analysis on the reviews dataset.
- Build a product recommendation system (recommendation engine) based on the ratings given by the users.
- Lastly fine-tune the recommendations using the sentiment analysis model you built earlier using the reviews dataset.
